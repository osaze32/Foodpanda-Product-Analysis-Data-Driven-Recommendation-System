# Project Overview

This project conducts a **product performance analysis on Foodpanda**, Asia’s leading food and grocery delivery platform, with the ultimate goal of developing a **data-driven recommendation system**. By evaluating sales across **region, city, gender, and age group**, the analysis uncovers customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and product trends.

The insights will identify high-performing and underperforming products, forming the foundation for a recommendation engine that suggests the right products to the right customers. These data-driven recommendations will also guide **targeted marketing strategies** such as loyalty programs, discounts, and personalized offers, ensuring improved customer engagement, retention, and revenue growth.

# Data Structure

The dataset comprises **transactional sales records from August 2023 to August 2025**, with each entry representing a single order placed on Foodpanda. It captures both **product-level details** (e.g., product category, price, order quantity, payment method) and **customer demographics** (e.g., region, city, gender, age group), making it well-suited for analyzing product performance and consumer behavior across different segments.

**Key Details:**

- **Source:** [Foodpanda Analysis Dataset 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabihazahid/foodpanda-analysis-dataset-2025)
- **Size:** 6,000 rows × 20 columns
- **Time Span:** August 2023 – August 2025

# Executive Summary


This project analyzes Foodpanda’s product performance to support the development of a **data-driven recommendation system**. Insights from the recommendation dashboard reveal high-demand products, leading cities, and seasonal sales patterns. Burgers, used as an example, show peak demand in **Multan, Lahore, and Islamabad**, particularly between **April and September**. These findings demonstrate how product insights can drive **targeted recommendations, promotions, and loyalty strategies**, ultimately boosting growth and customer engagement.

# Recommendations

The recommendations were derived from the **recommendation dashboard**, with burgers highlighted as an example to demonstrate how product insights guide decision-making. Although burgers were used for illustration, the same approach can be applied to other product categories to support targeted strategies and enhance overall performance.

**Burger Recommendations**

- **Priority Product:** McDonald’s Burger should be given a top recommendation, as it recorded the highest sales within the burger category.
- **Target Locations:** Focus recommendations on customers located in **Multan, Lahore, and Islamabad**, as these cities generated the top three sales volumes.
- **Seasonal Push:** Increase visibility and promotional efforts for burgers during the period of **April to September**, when sales historically rise.
